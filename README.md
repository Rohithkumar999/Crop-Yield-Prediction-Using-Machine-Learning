# Crop-Yield-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on predicting agricultural crop yields based on key environmental, soil, and crop-specific features using machine learning techniques.

Crop Yield Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project aims to predict agricultural crop yields using machine learning techniques based on environmental, soil, and crop-specific features. By analyzing variables such as soil moisture, temperature, rainfall, NDVI (vegetation index), crop type, and seasonality, the model forecasts crop yields with high accuracy. This helps support informed decision-making for farmers and agricultural planners, enabling optimized resource allocation and improved crop management.

Features
Data preprocessing including encoding categorical variables

Exploratory data analysis with descriptive statistics and visualizations

Crop yield prediction using a Random Forest regression model

Model evaluation using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared

Feature importance analysis to interpret influential factors on yield outcomes

Installation
Clone the repository:

git
Install required dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to perform data analysis, model training, prediction, and evaluation.

Modify input data or experiment with different machine learning algorithms as needed.

Data Sources
Synthetic data is used here for demonstration purposes; however, the methodology can be applied to real-world datasets from satellite remote sensing, IoT soil sensors, and meteorological stations.

Results
The model achieves strong accuracy in predicting crop yields and highlights the most important environmental and crop features driving productivity. Visualizations help uncover distribution patterns and feature relationships.

Future Work
Incorporate additional data sources such as pest/disease data and advanced weather forecasts

Experiment with other machine learning and deep learning models

Deploy a user-friendly web app for real-time prediction and recommendations
